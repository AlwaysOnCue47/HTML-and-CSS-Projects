			<p id="firstBodyParagraph">Using the HTML blockquote element; below is a quote from Wikipedia describing a historical fact about the city.</p>
			
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Ontario">
				<p>
				Kingston was named the first capital of the United Province of Canada on February 10, 1841. 
				While its time as a capital city was short and ended in 1844, 
				the community has remained an important military installation.
